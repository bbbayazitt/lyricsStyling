            All the things she said<br>
            All the things she said<br>
            Running through my head<br>
            Running through my head<br>
            Running through my head</p>
        </div>
        <div id="verse1">
            <p>I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost<br>
            If I'm asking for help it's only because<br>
            Being with you has opened my eyes<br>
            Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?</p>
        </div>
        <div id="pre-chorus">
            <p>I keep asking myself, wondering how<br>
            I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out<br>
            Want to fly to a place where it's just you and me<br>
            Nobody else, so we can be free<br>
            Nobody else, so we can be free</p>
        </div>
        <div id="chorus">
            <p>All the things she said<br>
            All the things she said<br>
            Running through my head<br>
            Running through my head<br>
            Running through my head<br>
            All the things she said<br>
            All the things she said<br>
            Running through my head<br>
            Running through my head<br>
            All the things she said (all the things she said)<br>
            This is not enough (enough, enough, enough)</p>
        </div>
        <div id="chorus2">
            <p>
            All the things she said <br>
            All the things she said <br>
            All the things she said <br>
            All the things she said <br>
            All the things she said <br>
            All the things she said <br>
            All the things she said <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="verse2">
            <p>
            And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed <br>
            They say it's my fault but I want her so much <br>
            Want to fly her away where the sun and rain <br>
            Come in over my face, wash away all the shame <br>
            When they stop and stare, don't worry me <br>
            'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me <br>
            I can try to pretend, I can try to forget <br>
            But it's driving me mad, going out of my head <br>
            </p>
        </div>
